I"<p>Virtual Reality is a fascinating field among the many branches of Artificial Intelligence. It is a question if it doesn’t stand on the same level as AI and can bring us tremendously big advantages as we see AI doing now in 2020. At the moment, Virtual Reality has already been adopted in a few industries like the gaming, construction, production, housing among others. For VR to become “the next big thing” in tech it has to be able to generate a huge value for industries. This is only logical as, increasing values means big investments made by invetors which in turn brings advancement to the field by research, building ease-of-use tools and opportunities. The way I see it is this, I have so much hope on VR becoming a massive technological field for so many reasons.</p>

<p>For Virtual Reality to be embraced by majority if not all industry, it has to impact them by bringing progression and developments in lesser amount of time. I think that currently VR can find application in many sectors but not all have adopted it seeing it as a relatively new technology, in short, a lot of skeptisism surrounds VR. But it should not be that way. Looking at it from a strategic viewpoint, you can see that generally, history always repeats itself. In 1998 when the internet was just taking off, many businesses feared to integrate it in their business and transfer their presence online, and now?, Every business that desires more customers simply knows that the solution is E-bussiness with good advertising and customer targeting. Another example can be seen in Artificial Intelligence. In,…………….. Ten Years Later, the result is massive alomost mind-blowing. Artificial Intelligence with it’s many sub-fields is the main talk and development force of every single industry in the world today. I see Virtual Reality having the same prospects in just a few years time and I want to be a participating force in this nurturing period of VR. Below I would give some exciting ideas that might seem even fantasical to some people, but after seeing past happenings and also knowing that the world we live in demands technology that can shift our concepts of what is possible, I have no reason to not believe in them.</p>

<p>Before you go on to read these future applications of VR, know that I don’t subject my mind to fantasy thinking rather I use my imaginations in a logical way. Another point is this, I am not just writing for that sake with the hope that in time to come, these technologies would be available to all, and I can be a part of the world that uses it to be more productive or just for fun, No, it is my goal to contribute to innovations in VR and these are no exception. For the fact that you are now reading this blog post, you most likely have a mind just like me and you’re generally interested in Virtual Reality.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I read an article “<a href="https://www.incomediary.com/business-startup-lessons-elon-musk">Elon Musk’s 15 Lessons for your Startup Business</a>” and among the lesson’s a phrase that stood out for me was “Think out of this World”. I have been using my mind in that frame ever since. To the skeptical, you can only see what Elon has achieved by thinking out of this world.</p>
