I"≈%<p>Have you been feeling frustared about the complexity of deep learning terms like Convolutional Neural networks and Recurrent NNs?</p>

<p>You have read countless articles with your goal in mind being to grasp and understand it finally - but it still doesn‚Äôt click?</p>

<p><b>Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre not alone</b></p>

<p>I‚Äôve had my fair share of frustration. Trust me, reading all those blog posts that focuses on the calculations and theory part of it and still feeling lost has led me to study it through more abstract and practical ways.</p>

<p>So even if you have found it difficult to assimilate, I want to clear out that situation and leave you a better deep learer with full understanding of CNNs and RNNs and excited to go forth and apply them in your projects. You can make it work, I‚Äôll show you how.</p>

<p>I assume that you have an understanding about Deep Learning, and maybe even CNNs. You have heard or Deep learning Countless times and Convolutional Neural networks, but how do they relate? Have you ever asked yourself!. Answering that question is the key to simplifying the mystery that surrounds CNNs. Let me answer that questions in the easiest way possible.</p>

<h3>What is Deep Learning and CNNs ( How do they relate?)</h3>

<p><i><b>Deep learning</b> is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.</i> The diagram below explains Deep learning

<p><i>In deep learning, a <b>Convolutional Neural Network</b> is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.</i></p>

<p><b>Recurrent Neural Networks</b> is a neural network designed for analyzing streams of data by means of hidden units where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step.</p>

<p>With the definitions above, you certainly have an idea of what Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks are, but yet, this goes:</p>

<h4>Simple and Detailed Explanation</h4>

<p><b>Deep learning</b> is a field of study that introduces the concept of ‚Äúartificial neural networks‚Äù which works similarly to how the brain processes information and aims to recreate that in the processing of data by computers. In deep learning artificial neural networks are networks/ that are linked to eachother through out the system. they learn representations from data unsupervised i.e unlike regular traditional machine learning algorithm which requires an ,,, deep learning networks do not need the true output of the data to learn. These kind of data are unlabeled.</p>

<p><b>Convolutional Neural Network</b> is a type of neural network that works specifically on image data to extract features that are unique in images, learns them through training/epochs and can carry out predictions on new unseen data using the representations learnt. This extraction of features work by passing a constant filter through the batch of images and applying a pooling layer onto the image which aims to highlight the features learnt. The convolution in CNNs means to convule/reduce the image to a smaller dimension and keep repeating this process.</p>

<p><b>Recurrent Neural Networks</b> uses a sequential mode of working, in which the previous layer contains information that must be passed to the next layer in the step</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>How they Relate?</h3>
<p>Deep Learning is a sub-field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It uses deep neural networks to learn from unstructured data.</p>

<p>Convolutional Neural netowrks(CNNs) are a class of Deep Neural networks(DNNs) that is used on ‚Äúimage data‚Äù to learn features through downsizing, kernel passing, and pooling.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a Recurrent neural Network is a class of DNNs that is usually used on text and sequential data for prediction the sequence of next few occurence. Examples of cases a RNN would be used: Chat/Text keyboards, Language Translation, Music Generation, etc. Now that you understand the overall concept of this subject, lets look at CNNs and RNNs on a deeper but straight forward level</p>

<h3>CNN Vs RNN</h3>

<p><i>CNNs are used to extract features from unlabeled image data. If you are working on an image data of any sort, use CNN. CNNs are used to build models that cn take as input an image and output its class(Image Classification), Objects-in-image(Object detection) and even as far as thier positions in the image(Object Localization)</i></p>

<p>The structure of a CNN is basically a collection of neural networks, but what makes it different and unique to feature extraction in images is it‚Äôs layers and thier functions. The CNN is made up of 2 important layers; Convolution and Max Pooling. It aslo has a kernel/filter which is for sliding through the image. So here is how it works:</p>

<p><u>Example</u>
An Image of dimension 26X26 is first read and converted to 1s and 0s. Usually most images contains 3 channels which makes it a ‚Äúcolor‚Äù image. Grayscale Images has just 1 channel. A 3X3 kernel is slided through the image. It slides through with a stride that must be defined first. The stride determines how many columns is jumped over during the sliding. So if the <b style="color: blue;">STRIDE = 2</b>, it moves over 2 columns and lands on the third one. The kernel contains all the numbers in the image enclosed as fits inside the filter. This extracted number is later applied to Activation RELU where all numbers less that 1 are rounded down to 0 and numbers greater than 1 are left as they are. This activation is processed on all the extracted kernels. The last stage is usually the Max pooling layer. The Max Pool layer looks at the box of number and simply picks the highest number in the group. This is done to all the other kernels and results in new sets of numbers with one from the previous kernel box. Now that the filter has been passed through, the Max Pool reveals the strongest lines in the image which can be noticed from the pattern in its numbers. The diagram below describe the Convolution process graphically:</p>

<p>This explanation of CNNs shou;d give you a basic understanding of it‚Äôs concept and workings, however for you to deeply ‚Äúsee‚Äù how it works, you must practice using it. That‚Äôs a mistake I see most beginners make; you want to understand CNNs, you‚Äôve read articles on it but really never practically worked on it. The most basic project to start off with using CNN is <b>Image Classification</b>. This project tutorial would guide you through <a href="https://channelai.netlify.app/image-classification-api-in-tensorflow/">How to Build an Image Classification Model and Web App with Tensorflow </a></p>

<p>RNN captures the sequential information present in the input data i.e. dependency between the words in the text while making predictions</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid" alt="Deep Learning Diagram" src="https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1d_POV7c8fzHbKuTgJzCxtA.gif" /></p>

<p>Sequential types of data require a different typr of neural network from CNN in order to be processed. Examples of sequential data are ; audio sound waves, single characters/words making up a text, projecting the movement of stock prices, genomic sequences and many other cases.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>
This example below would explain what sequence/RNNs are, why they are used instead of CNN and in what kind of cases:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>You are given a sentence: This morning I took my cat for a</td>
      <td>walk. You want to build a deep Learning network to solve the task, but theres one underlying issue, ‚ÄúA feed-forward DNN can only take a fixed length input vector‚Äù, and our problem here has a varying input length. Some sentence in the dataset are five words, others six and so on. Our ideal model needs to be able to handle variable lengths of inputs. There are three ways/ideas we can decide to take to solve this problem:</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Idea 1</h4>
<p>: Hard code a certain length of input when defining the model hyper-pararmeters, i.e given a word: <b>I know how to speak French | fluently</b>. If we choose a lenght of 3 for our model then, the sentence would be trimmed to; <i>to speak french</i>. Using this method, we have an history problem:
<b>Problem 1</b>Can‚Äôt Model Long-Term Dependencies: In this problem, we need information from earler in the sentence but since our model is only using the 3 previous words, it cannot solve tasks like this.An example of a sentence with long-term dependencies: <b>France is where I grew up, but now I live in Boston. I speak fluent <em>__</em> (French)</b></p>

<h4>Idea 2</h4>
<p>: Use Entire sequence as sets of counts</p>
