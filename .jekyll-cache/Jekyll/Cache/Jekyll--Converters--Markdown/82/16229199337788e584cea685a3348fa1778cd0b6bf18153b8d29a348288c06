    <p class="card-text">Enter the virtual world of Graffiti Bombing and become a graffiti writer. Whether you’re a new artist, seasoned veteran or even all-city hero, you can now enjoy the thrill of being a graffiti writer in the crime-free (relative) safety of virtual reality. <br />
    Graffiti Bombing humbly started as a fairly small project, in terms of scope and planned features. Since then much has changed and it has gradually grown in scope and ambition. To realize that ambition is going to take more time, hard work and dedication. <br />
    Polishing existing, and developing new or advanced features takes time, however we wanted to get players into Graffiti Bombing sooner, so EA gives us an opportunity to do that. <br />
    Releasing early gives you the players an opportunity to experience and send us feedback as we continue to develop. We’ll consider all feedback and if appropriate will incorporate into development.
