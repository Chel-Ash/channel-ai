I"P<p>In this tutorial you would learn some methods that can be used to improve a model’s accuracy. This can be achieved in a few lines of code using Tensorflow by just importing required libraries. If you haven’t already, you can build a Tensorflow Image Classification model following the guide in the last post <a href="">How to Build an Image Classification API in Tensorflow</a>. This is an overview of what we would be touching on in this tutorial:</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improving Model’s Accuracy</li>
  <li>Dropouts: Understanding how it reduces Overfitting</li>
  <li>Batch Normalization</li>
  <li>Buiding a Cifar10 Model with 85% Accuracy</li>
</ul>
