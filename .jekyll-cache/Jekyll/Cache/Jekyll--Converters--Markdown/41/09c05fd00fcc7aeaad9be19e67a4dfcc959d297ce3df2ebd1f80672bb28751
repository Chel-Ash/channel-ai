I"<p>In a Multi-class problem, we have a few constant features that are [present in out dataset:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple Classes/ Labels</li>
  <li>Categorical Data
*</li>
</ul>

<p>With these, letâ€™s proceed to learn an efficient approach to solving problems of this naturee, Note: In this tutorial, I would strive to extend and provide directions for other likely cases e.g (A multi-class problem but with numerical data?). Letâ€™s get started;</p>

<p>Tutorial Overview</p>
<ul>
  <li>MultiClass Image Classification</li>
  <li>Data preparation with Pandas</li>
  <li>What is the Nasnet application</li>
  <li>Why Use Nasnet for propblem</li>
  <li>Solutions &amp; Training</li>
</ul>
