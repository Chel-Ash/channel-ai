I"Z<p>In this tutorial we would explore a necessary topic in deep learning - overfitting. We would learn what it is ,and how to combact it using known regularization methods like dropouts, batch normalization etc. We also cover how to build an Image Classify using the popular Cifar 10 and Cifar 100 datasets that achieves high accuracy of 85%.</p>
