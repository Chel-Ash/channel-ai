I"À<p>No doubt, Ai is one of the most crucial future technologies which is being harnessed today and transforming our daily lives. A very important branch of Artificial Intelligence ‚ÄúDeep Learning‚Äù has arguably the biggest impact in AI progress.  If you‚Äôre a beginner looking for the right free resources to learn deep learning and discover applications in fields like Computer Vision, NLP, this plog post is you. This article will introduce the best books to learn deep learning in 2020 and how to practice deep learning</p>

<p>Now that you have an idea of the stepss taking us through this tutorial, Let‚Äôs begin with it.</p>

<h3>Gentle Introduction to Deep learning</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep learning</a> (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p>

<p>Ok, so that‚Äôs more like a very official definition of deep learning. An easier one you should understand better; Deep learning refers to the various process and methods involving the use of Artificial Neural Networks to build models, functions that learn from real-world data and produce outputs closely related to what they were trained on. Now this is probably a vague definition for it, in the sense that some deep learning models use unsupervised method of mapping functions. I could go around and cite a perfect definition for it, but honestly that is usually rarely important for you and me. If you understand the above definitions, you are very well 60% ahead on what deep learning is all about because anything further than that, is already taking about a specific branch of deep learning like computer vision, natural language processing etc.</p>

<h3>Fields of Deep Learning</h3>
<p>We come now to a place that we can spend lots of time defining concepts and their differences to each other. The fields or branches of deep learning are many and new theories keeps popping every now and then. This is so because, scientists and researchers are constantly try to improve upon state-of-the-art models and also achieve new milestones. Several years ago, I should think the world was focusing more on how to improve traditional Machine Learning models and eliminate the repetitive Rules and Data In - Answers Out for a scalable solution like Data and Answers in - Models out. Now we have Models that are scalable and more confident unseen situations. I could still remember when I took the course <a href="">Machine Learning</a> by Andrew Ng, it was everything I was looking for, I was very happy with it, a few months later I took the course <a href="">Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning</a> and I could immediately see the huge difference. The difference being using tarditional ML methods against Convolutional neural Networks etc.</p>

<p>Not to go out of scope, the field of Deep Learning is diverese and keeps growing, here I would list out a few of the more common ones that i have at one time or other come across. I am not going to be explaining them in detail, this post is more focused on Deep learning and how to get started as a deep learner and the books on deep learning to read that would guide your progress:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computer Vision: Computer Vision, often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers ‚Äúsee‚Äù and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem of computer vision appears simple because it is trivially solved by people, even very young children. Nevertheless, it largely remains an unsolved problem based both on the limited understanding of biological vision and because of the complexity of vision perception in a dynamic and nearly infinitely varying physical world.</p>
