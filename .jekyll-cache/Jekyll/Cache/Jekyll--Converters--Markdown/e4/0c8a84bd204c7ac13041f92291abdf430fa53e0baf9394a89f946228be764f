I"J<p>With the rise of Virtual Reality Technology we have seen many Industries have looked to adopt it in their business, among these the most successful have been the gaming industry. There has been a sprawl of VR Games released every now and then. Just as it was with mobile games, it also becomes necessary for gamers to choose the absolute best of them in which they can spend money and get the best value. If you are an avid gamer like I am, you would only want to spend time on those games that derive the best satisfaction.</p>

<h2>Hardware for VR Gaming</h2>
<p>Our list of VR games covers the top titles for the HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift S (the successor to the Oculus Rift), PlayStation VR, Valve Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Many of these devices (and the games themselves) have gotten cheaper in the past couple of years, which makes them a more easily justifiable purchase. 
Gamers using Headsets like the HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift S, Valve Index and Windows Mixed Reality has to consider the hardware requirements for them. For the best experience use top-of-the-line-GPUs mounted on powerful gaming desktops or VR-ready laptops.</p>

<p>Using a few sources, reviews, gaming know-how and having actually tested a few of these games, I decided to conjure in a top ten list the Best VR Games for August 2020. You can find links leading to where you can find them.

    <p class="card-text">A VR Horror Experience. After having checked into a haunted hospital, you are being confronted with its evil resident who is not too pleased about your visit.
    You are trapped in a wheelchair, unable to move anything other than your head.
	This might sound like a less interactive experience, yet this decision in game design makes the experience even more claustrophobic.
	The VR experience is designed to adapt to user reactions and actions. Even though there are no active game objects to interact with, events are depended on head movements, speeds and viewing angles. Sound, noise, shadows, explosions and lights distract viewers and help guide their views in certain directions.</p>
