I"“<p>In this tutorial you would see how to apply state-of-the-art R-CNN architecture model built on the MS Coco dataset for Object Detection on a new Dataset. We use Transfer Learning for efficient and faster training epochs. You would learn how to Install the R-CNN Library, install the dataset we want to make predictions on, parse the annotation files for bounding boxes, Train Mask R-CNN Model on dataset using Transfer Learning.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gentle introduction to Object Detection</li>
