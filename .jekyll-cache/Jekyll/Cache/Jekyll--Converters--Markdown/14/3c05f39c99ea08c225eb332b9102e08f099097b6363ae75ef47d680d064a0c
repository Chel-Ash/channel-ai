I"[<p>In my previous post, I gave a simplified introduction to Machine Learning for beginners. It therefore brings the need for me to write a post on “Vectorization”. You might be hearing it for the first time or you have possibly come across it sometime. Either one of those, I can tell you that it isn’t a difficult subject, in fact in the field of Machine Learning I found it much easier than a normal iterative code (for &amp; while loop). Now lets begin, by the end of this post I want you to understand what vectorization is, it’s application and how to use it in your ML Implementation.</p>
