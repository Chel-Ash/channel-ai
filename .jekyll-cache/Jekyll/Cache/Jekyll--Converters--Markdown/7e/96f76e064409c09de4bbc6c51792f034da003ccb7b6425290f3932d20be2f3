<p>This page tells you a little bit about me.<br />
My name is Chelsea and Iâ€™m the creator of Channel-AI site.I created it mainly to understand AI and sub fields as much as i can and not just scrap through. Because ive learned that teaching or writing about something fixes it deeper in your mind. Machine Learning and AI is a field that needs a very high concentration and understanding.Im hoping taking on this project should help me get immersed in it. Also as a second reason, to gain some exposure and show what i can do. This page would be updated with more information in a not soo long while.</p>
