I"y	<p>Virtual Reality is a fascinating field among the many branches of Artificial Intelligence. It is a question if it doesn’t stand on the same level as AI and can bring us tremendously big advantages as we see AI doing now in 2020. At the moment, Virtual Reality has already been adopted in a few industries like the gaming, construction, production, housing among others. For VR to become “the next big thing” in tech it has to be able to generate a huge value for industries. This is only logical as, increasing values means big investments made by invetors which in turn brings advancement to the field by research, building ease-of-use tools and opportunities. The way I see it is this, I have so much hope on VR becoming a massive technological field for so many reasons.</p>

<p>For Virtual Reality to be embraced by majority if not all industry, it has to impact them by bringing progression and developments in lesser amount of time. I think that currently VR can find application in many sectors but not all have adopted it seeing it as a relatively new technology, in short, a lot of skeptisism surrounds VR. But it should not be that way. Looking at it from a strategic viewpoint, you can see that generally, history always repeats itself. In 1998 when the internet was just taking off, many businesses feared to integrate it in their business and transfer their presence online, and now?, Every business that desires more customers simply knows that the solution is E-bussiness with good advertising and customer targeting. Another example can be seen in Artificial Intelligence. In,…………….. Ten Years Later, the result is massive alomost mind-blowing. Artificial Intelligence with it’s many sub-fields is the main talk and development force of every single industry. I see Virtual Reality having the same prospects in just a few years time. And I want to be a participating force in this nurturing period of VR.</p>
