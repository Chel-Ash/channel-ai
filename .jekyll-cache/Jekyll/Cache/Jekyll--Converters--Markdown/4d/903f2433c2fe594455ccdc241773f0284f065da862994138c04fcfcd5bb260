<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Object Detection is a Computer Vision task that involves identifying the presence, location, and class of one or more objects in an image. It is a challenging problem that involves building upon methods for Object recognition (e.g. where are they), object localization (e.g. what are their extent), and object classification (e.g. what are they).</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we are going to use the Region based Convolutional Neural network (R-CNN) to perform object Detection and idetify kangaroos in images. This pre-built model can be used on other datasets to identify other classes of images. For now, we look at a single class (i.e kangaroo) of image.</p>

<p>We want our model to predict the objects in unseen images and draw a bounding box around them. As we implement this simple task using a simgle class of image, we can get a better understanding of this task and later move on to larger classes of images like in the Coco Dataset.</p>

<p>Here, instead of developing an implementation of the R-CNN or Mask R-CNN model from scratch, we can use a reliable third-party implementation built on top of the Keras deep learning framework. The best-of-breed third-party implementations of Mask R-CNN is the Mask R-CNN Project developed by Matterport. The project is open source released under a permiss</p>
