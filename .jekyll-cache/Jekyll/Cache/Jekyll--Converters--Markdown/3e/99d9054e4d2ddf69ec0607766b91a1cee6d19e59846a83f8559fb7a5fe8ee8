<h3>Gentle Introduction to Deep learning</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep learning</a> (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p>

<p>Ok, so that‚Äôs more like a very official definition of deep learning. An easier one you should understand better; Deep learning refers to the various process and methods involving the use of Artificial Neural Networks to build models, functions that learn from real-world data and produce outputs closely related to what they were trained on. Now this is probably a vague definition for it, in the sense that some deep learning models use unsupervised method of mapping functions. I could go around and cite a perfect definition for it, but honestly that is usually rarely important for you and me. If you understand the above definitions, you are very well 60% ahead on what deep learning is all about because further than that,</p>
