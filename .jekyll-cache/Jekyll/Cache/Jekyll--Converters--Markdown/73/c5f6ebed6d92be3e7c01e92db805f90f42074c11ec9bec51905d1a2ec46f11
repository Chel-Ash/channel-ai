I"€<p>As someone just starting out in Machine Learning and related fields. I created this blog in other to share my ideas to like-minded individuals out then, I wanted to be able to talk about Machine Leaning in a Simplified way. When I just started out, trying to wrap my head around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, i tried a lot of different sources finding the best way to understand it. I was so much interested in Artificial Intelligence in full, wanting to understand how robots worked because in short, it was fascinating to think about. I soon enough found out that to make some very meaningful progress I had to start with Machine-Learnign and i did just that. Enough with the Introduction, Iâ€™m going to give a basic and simplified introduction to Machine-Learning (often abbreviated as ML) for complete beginners who want to start their journey in this Field of Study.</p>
