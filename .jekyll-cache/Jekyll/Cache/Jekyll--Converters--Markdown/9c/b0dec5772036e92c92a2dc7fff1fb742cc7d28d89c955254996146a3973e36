I"<p>Virtual Reality is a fascinating field among the many branches of Artificial Intelligence. It is a question if it doesn’t stand on the same level as AI and can bring us tremendously big advantages as we see AI doing now in 2020. At the moment, Virtual Reality has already been adopted in a few industries like the gaming, construction, production, housing among others. For VR to become “the next big thing” in tech it has to be able to generate a huge value for industries. This is only logical as, increasing values means big investments made by invetors which in turn brings advancement to the field by research, building ease-of-use tools and opportunities. The way I see it is this, I have so much hope on VR becoming a massive technological field for so many reasons.</p>
