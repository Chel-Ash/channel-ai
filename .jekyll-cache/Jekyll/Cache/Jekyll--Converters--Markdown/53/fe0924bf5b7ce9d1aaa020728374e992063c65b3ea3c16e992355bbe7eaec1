I"½<p>Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are a type of neural network used for machine learning, computer vision, and other forms of artificial intelligence. Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning in which regularities and patterns of input data are discovered and learned so that a model can be used to generate and output new examples that can plausibly be taken from the original data set.</p>
