    Players can fly and interact with each other online in VR with realistic physics-based controls. The controls are completely VR and natural, just as you would use thruster controllers for a real jetpack (look up Jetman as an example). It's truly free range of motion and natural movement, not the teleport or D-pad controls of most VR games. This includes but is not limited to being able to hover, drift, spin, flip, and burst through the sky without ever hitting any special buttons (all controller angle/position based). It's up to your own imagination what combination of moves or positions you might be able to do in the air. You can even now swing and do hookshots with the new grappling cables.
