      <title>UNDERSTANDING LEARNING CURVES FOR THE TRAINING AND VALIDATION SETS</title>
      <link>https://channelai.netlify.app/apples/</link>
      <description>After successfully training a model, we all want it to be as perfect as possible. The way we do this is in Machine Learning is minimizing the error loss on our dataset. But theres a catch, what if we end up overfitting our training set and our learned algorithm fails to generalize on new data. Learn how to balance Learning curves with the Validation set</description>

      <title>HOW TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM IN MINIMAL TIME</title>
      <link>https://channelai.netlify.app/bananas/</link>
      <description>When building Machine Learning systems , a Data Engineer has to iterate between a number of compulsory to optional processes. How they do this determines the resources(time) that is consumed in training the model. Should you focus more on collecting lots of data for your system or are there more important things?</description>
