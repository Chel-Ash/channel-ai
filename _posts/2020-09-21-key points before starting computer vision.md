Can you imagine navigating through an unknown city without Google Maps?It is usually a tough and tiring ordeal, all paths seems to lead to nothing and at the end you even ask yourself why you took that path in the first place.

That's often what the first Computer Vision project feels like. I can personally attest to this because I have been through it and now I know some real facts of what should and not be done.

Learning the basics of CV and building a Computer Vision Model in tensorflow is great - but if you think that alone would land you a great job and carry you on to success, you'll be in for a big shock. In reality, it just isn't. For me, this reality hit home when I began building models on after the other, on colab solving projects on Kaggle, blog tutorials and official tensorflow website. There were other tons of things which were just as important, such as data collection, cleaning, exploration etc.

A few things I realized - problem solving skills, definite purpose, imagination, creativity are more helpful than mastering model building algorithms and tools. Trust me, this is way important than you might think.


In this article, I will be sharing 10 key points that I wish I knew when I started my Computer Vision journey, I hope this will help you out in your own CV journey too.
