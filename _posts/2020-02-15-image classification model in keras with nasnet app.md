In a Multi-class problem, we have a few constant features that are [present in out dataset:
* Multiple Classes/ Labels
* Categorical Data
*

With these, let's proceed to learn an efficient approach to solving problems of this naturee, Note: In this tutorial, I would strive to extend and provide directions for other likely cases e.g (A multi-class problem but with numerical data?). Let's get started;


Tutorial Overview
* MultiClass Image Classification
* Data preparation with Pandas
* What is the Nasnet application
* Why Use Nasnet for propblem
* Solutions & Training
