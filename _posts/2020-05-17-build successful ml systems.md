When building Machine Learning systems , a Data Engineer has to iterate between a number of compulsory to optional processes. How they do this determines the resources(time) that is consumed in training the model. Should you focus more on collecting lots of data for your system or are there more important things?

```css
#container {
    float: left;
    margin: 0 -240px 0 0;
    width: 100%;
}
```
<div class= "codes">
{% highlight matlab %}
<form action="action_page.php">
  First name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="firstname" value="Mickey"><br>
  Last name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="lastname" value="Mouse"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
