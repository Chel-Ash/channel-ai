In my previous post, I gave a simplified introduction to Machine Learning for beginners. It therefore brings the need for me to write a post on "Vectorization". You might be hearing it for the first time or you have possibly come across sometime. Either one of those, I can tell you that it isn't difficult subject, in fact in the field of Machine Learning i found it much easier than a normal iterative code (for & while loop). Now lets begin, by the end of this post I want you to understand what vectorization is, it's application and how to use it in your ML journey.

The title of this post actually says "Vectorization in ML with MATLAB", so you can tell I would be teaching you how to vectorize you code in a MATLAB Environment, but you should know that almost all programming languages codes can be vectorized. Now let's look at a simplified definition of vectorization.
