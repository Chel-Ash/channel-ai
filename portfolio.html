      <p>My name is Chelsea, I study concepts and technologies in the field of AI and ML with the vision of one day having my own company that specializes in Virtual Reality & Computer Vision. On the process of getting there, a lot of skills has to be learned, either for the purpose of attainment of that definite goal or as a way to offer job recruiters my services.<br><br>

      To an extent, a lot of self-confidence is required to build oneself up sufficiently in the field of their choice, leaving aside the fact that you have to consider a lot of options and ruminate over it extremely, at least that's the way it has been for me, but I know I would finally arrive at my answers.<br><br>

      As easy an answer as possible, I thought that the best way to show what I can do is to actually learn those skills and practice on them in terms of short or long term projects. Short term projects are perhaps those that you want to add up in your portfolio while long term might be the ones that complement your overall plans for the(your) future.<br><br>

      Below are a few of the skills I've managed to gather within a few months. What I want the most? To be sufficiently equipped with enough skills, networks, ideas and money that would push my long-term goal a little closer.</p>

      <ul style="padding: 0;">
        <ol>1. I consider myself a near expert in Machine Learning(Algorithms). I can use and implement all popular ML Algorithms to build systems that can make predictions at a minimal level. Ive practised extensively with ML Algorithms mainly during my <a href="">Machine Learning Online course on Coursera</a> I completed the course with a score of 95%. Below is an image showing my Certificate and a link that you can verify the results directly on Coursera.<br><br>

  <a></ol>

      <ol>2. I can use Tensorflow for classification or regression problems. I understand the loss function, optimizer, model fit and all the important functions that are necessary for building a model. Using Keras as the back-end library i can do data preprocessing with numpy, callbacks, evaluation and a few other things. Ive had practice using Tensorflow on the MNIST dataset for HandWritten Digits classification and MNIST dataset for Clothing items classification. I have a Certificate on <strong><em><a href="">Tensorflow for Basic Image Classification</a></em>, a Guided Coursera Project. </strong>Image and direct link to Coursera below.<br><br>
