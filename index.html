title: Learn CV & VR in 2020 from Beginner Level - ChannelAI.com
description: Get introduced to Computer Vision with practical skill acquisition. In this blog, I write about my journey in becoming good at Computer Vision. My End goal is to apply this technology in a masterful and problem-solving way. I want to cover the areas that are important, that develops my expertise in CV and not just learn a bunch of things that I would not use.

       <hr style="border: 1.5px black solid;" width="85%">
       <p>In this website I hope to document my journey of learning about Computer Vision and Virtual Reality. With Artificial Intelligence, it is necessary for one to specialize in one of it's fascinating fields. I am excited about Virtual Reality because well, it brings imagination to life, also the animation we have seen in movies can truly become reality. My main goal for this website and myself is to: Discover and Practice a real-world application of Computer Vision, help people through tutorials in their learning goals in searching for resources and finally to achieve a life-long dream!
        I want this blog to be my medium of tuning in and having constant awareness of the goals I want to achieve. In short, I want to understand CV & VR and apply this technology in large-scale. Whatever your personal; goals may be, I hope I can be helpful along the way.<span style="font-weight: bold"></span></p>

           <li><h3>Learn</h3></li>
          <li>The first step to mastering any skill is learning about it. In practice, this is usually where the longest hours are spent. Here, I'm going to learn Computer Vision through solid resources I can find around. There are a number of them. I'm going to learn by following guides, building projects and writing articles on them. Follow along in the blog posts too. One questions beginners ask most often when introduced to any new field is <b>"How can I learn it?"</b>. This is a question I have pondered myself a lot, and when I do, I need an honest opinion from people that already passed beginner stage and are effectively applying their skill. To see my answer to this question, visit <a href="">here</a>.</li>

           <li><h3>Train</h3></li>
          <li>Training of Machine Learning & Computer Vision Models is a task that has gradually become within the means of any individual today thanks to the many tools available that significantly makes it easy. In this time, any aspiring ML enginner can build models easily even without hardware resources that can handle heavy processing. Aside considering the hardware side of it, actually building models can't be said to be difficult, it's more like learning sets of tools and libraries that you need at different times to plug in. Training Models usually is 50% Data cleaning and visualization, and the remaining time can be shared among building, deployment etc.</li>

           <li><h3>Deploy</h3></li>
          <li>Any AI company in industry has a lot of options to be considered to ship to production level. Deployment is an important aspect of building Machine Learning models, both for beginners or experts. I fancy the idea of model deployment, but ofcourse you have to deploy models that are useful in solving some problems. You can either be a business trying to better serve customers with new ML APIs or an individual building up skills to show prospective employers, in both cases deployment has to be considered. Like I said there are a lot of options to be considered, and while I have merely brushed the surface, in coming weeks, I should be doing more of this. Depending on what your ideas for Cv progression is, deployment is something we would be talking about in future posts.</li>
